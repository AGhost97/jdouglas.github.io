  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

    <p>When and where did it start: As a child, I always had a fascination for technology to a potentially unhealthy degree. My dad was a systems administrator throughout my childhood and always built himself new pcs for work and gaming in his spare time. My natural interest became intensified when the student laptops program came to be a thing when I was in high school and I had access to a laptop I could bring home and use in my spare time. My interest was further increased when I started studying engineering and got into the programming side of things through mechatronics and the coding class I did at UWS. So when it came time to choose to move on from Hospitality T programming was the natural choice for me. I chose RMIT because it affords me the ability to study on my own time and around a full-time work week. It allows me to be flexible during a period of time when my time is chaotic. As for my expectations, I don't really have any major expectations. I came into my studies looking to make a major change in my life and my studies are just the avenues to do so.</p>

    <div class="Job Description"><img src="Job description.png" width="25%" text-align="center">

    <p>The job presented is a team based coding position that allows problem solvers to excell in a position with room for creativity and potential for more interesting projects through things like military contracts. The position requires the applicant to be experienced and have degrees in software engineering and electronics engineering. The applicant also needs skills in: c# and C++, using WPF and MVMM in a windows environment, app development, machile learning algoriths, image processing algorithms and using CI/CD technologies. Applicants are also needed to be able to work in teams and be able to communicate effectively and break down complex problems into simple solutions. My personal; experience in this is fairly limited with the majority of my experience being in a small amount of understanding of C++ and working in team environments. I personally plan on finishing my course and learn to become an enthuisastic and intellgent coder and work my way up to the point where I can be confident enough to make and present my own applications and ideas.

  <h2>Personality Tests and results</h2>

      <h3>What do the test results mean to me?</h3>
          <p>The results of the Auditory Learner test was actually super surprising. I personally suspected for years I was better with reading and comprehending a large bulk of information. Especially with most of my personal childhood and teenhood spent reading. The other results on the otherhand arent super perplexing. I spent most of my life attempting to understand myself and my shortcomings to better enable me to better relate to those around me and I personally do hope that I continue my attempts to be self aware about myself.</p>
      <h3>How do they influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
          <p>The results personally might influence me to be better engaged in discussions from the get go. It might also change the way I approach dealing and communcating with others as I can tend to be more abbrasive and blind towards others general emotions and reactions to my actions.</p>
      <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
          <p>I should probably look for team members who are easy going and have an easier time gelling with more people who have stronger communication skills to make up for the personal skills I lack with others. I also personally would want to look for people who can take up more prominent leadership roles in a team as that tends to be something I tend to not enjoy doing myself inside group environments, or look for those that are capable of being independant workers themselves.</p>

  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
      <p>One issue this year is the inability of trip planners like google maps to have real-time information about road closures during floods and other events that would create road closures. The proposed application will be a dynamic trip planning application that allows the user to plan trips on the fly with real-time adaptations based on available information. The goal of this application is to make transportation, either private or public, more easily possible for areas like the Hawkesbury and flood-prone areas of Queensland for people to be able to move around during times of floods and lead to less panic in those times.</p>

      <p>In the past 3 years, the Hawkesbury has had to deal with flooding on 4 separate occasions that in the recent 2 floods have led to a great deal of confusion about bus timetables and delays around flooded roads, and changes to timetables on apps and websites that allow the user to plan trips. In particular, Google Maps routinely failed to update when bus trips were canceled in the area until 20 minutes after the bus is listed to arrive at a particular stop. These applications also failed to account for bus routes being diverted and for bus replacements for trains.</p>

      <p>The proposed project would be a website and application that would allow users to plan and save trips for regular use that update in real-time. These trip plans would, in real-time, change their routes based on information from transportation and websites like NRMA. Users would be able to see variations on travel plans, detours, road closures, traffic times, and delays to public transport on the fly and be able to change routes on the fly and minimize issues and hassles in planning travel with everything being in a particular location on the users' phone. Users will also get real-time data about their busses and locations if a bus is running late or early. When users start planning their trip, the app will use information from places like bus ways and traffic tracking websites to provide users with options from point a to point b. The app will adapt travel times based on traffic changes and provide alternative routes if users want to avoid traffic. The app will also provide up-to-date information on bus locations along routes so that users can keep track of their travel. During floods, it will provide up-to-date information for users on what bus routes will remain running and roads that are closed for drivers to avoid flooded areas better.
      </p>

      <p>Most of the skills required are in application and algorith development. The application itself needs to have algorithms that can take into account GPS location, information from multiple sources and can constantly process new information to recalculate routes. One of the better tools to use for the development of such an application would be tools like FLutter developed by google will allow for easier creation of apps for IOS and android as they are the primary market for an application like this to be tailored towards. For the website most of the work will be adapting the same algorithms into the website to fulfil the same function as the application would, with most of the work being in HTML and JS with CSS for general polishing of the website. A large portion of this apps development would also need to use open source tools like Open Trip Planner (OTP) to be able to create the app with skills in JS and knowledge of APIs necessary for the application to function.</p>

      <p>If the project itself is successful it would provide users with a more efficient trip planning application that can more easily provide users with up to date information about road closures, public transport delays and traffic. It would make traveling during peak times managable and allow for more people to be able to get from point a to point b in the event of road closures and flooding leading to less issues in terms of not having access to reliable work.</p>
